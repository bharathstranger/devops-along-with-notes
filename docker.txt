why docker :- docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies
what is docker:- docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating  and running containers
what is ecosystem:- means docker client  |
						  docker server	 |
						  docker machine | these all tools and peice of sofware are togeather became ecosystem or platform of docker
						  docker images	 |
						  docker hub	 |
						  docker compose |

docker version is the command to check the version of docker which installed on your local machine
		docker version
docker run:- docker run is the command to pull the image from hub if we dont find anything in locally 
			steps for the pull
			"docker run hello-world"
			 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
			 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
				(amd64)
			 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
				executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
			 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
				to your terminal.
docker cli:- cli is also called client it is the tool that we are going to issue commands and it actually doesnt do anything with container and images this is help to interact with the another peice of software that called docker server 
	docker server is also called docker daemon

docker server:- this is actually a peice of software responsible for craeting containers images maintaining containers uploading images and everything possibly maching around the world of docker
				the deamon is nothing but docker server
				
what is a container:- a container is a instance of an image 

image:- image is a single file with all the dependencies and configurations repuired to run a specific program and to create a container

docker run workflow: once we run the docker run command 1st it will check the local machine wheather we have that

namespacing: isolating resources per process

control groups:limit amount of resources used per process

section 1 12.video not understood

what is container: container is a running process along with a subset of physical resources on the computer or allocated to the	process specifically

what is image: image is a snapshot of file system and very specific startup command as well

docker run in detail:
 create and running a container using an image
		docker run <imagename>
