git branch :  branching is the stratagey in this branching we will be having multiple branches once you add file in one branch it will reflect in all the branches 
			  unless u add and commit 
	
git merge: in merging we merge the branch to branch basically we merge only feature branches in production level 
			for merging we will get the merge id with this we can revert the changes back to previous state this will be helpful when ever the client is not satisfied with the current version
			if we want to merge the develop with master we s hould checkout to master and do the merging once we done with merging we can push the changes to the remote repository by using git push origin <br> name
			
git revert

	before commit:
	git reset is the command to get the file from stagging to index
					git reset HEAD filename
					so it will be unstagged means it will move to working area (stagging to working area)
					
				this is basically we do before commit
		
	after commit:
		git reset HEAD~ (this will revert the changes after the commit)
		it will move to working area basically we do this when ever we want changes in file
