diff b/w apt-get update and upgrade is update will update the packages and upgrade will upgrade the packages which installed basically available in the system

to set configuration

  git config --global user.name "name"
  git config --global user.email "email"
  git config --list will give the complete configuration properties of the machine
  in git configuration  we can change any properties

  git --help

to get help for particular command
  git 	help add (or) anything

to create a first git repository 
  git init (in the location where you want to start project)
  the project directory is a hidden directory

 git add is the command to add a file from working to stagging
  git add filename
  git add . (to add all files in the local)
  git add s* (to add the files which starts letter S)

 to check the status of the file 
  git status

git commit is the command to save the changes of your actions
  git commit -m "msg"

  git log (it will display with the numeric value)

in a organisation we will be having 10 people to see commits of a particular person?
  git log --author="author name"

git workflow
  working area --> stagging area --> repository area

to see the diff b/w the files or versioned files and it will display the date in the files
  git diff file names

deleting a file in git

  git with github:
  
git is a seperate process and it is a versione controle management tool 

git hub is a seperate entity and it is a centrloised repository

local repository is															remote repository		 |
				1. working directory																 |
									git add -->									git push --->		 |
				2.stagging area																		 | git workflow					
									git commit -->								git pull <---		 |
				3.local repository																	 |
																									 |

git hub is basically repository hosting service means where we put our code it is like cloud for code and it is centrloised repository and code hosting plotform

to initialize git remote repository  to the local repo we need to initialize local repo .git and next we should add git remote repository by using the command 
		git remote add origin and url of remote repository
 
to sync the remote repo to the local repo we need to pull the remote repo to local repo
		git pull <url> of the remote repo
		

BRANCHES:

branch in a git is pointer to commit

to create a branch we use
			git branch <branch name>

basically we will be master branch which is default branch and main branch 
	everyone in a team can create their own branch to commit their changes to their own branch once they done the testing they merge to the master branch
	
to switch from one branch to other branch
		git checkout branch name

git branch <to check in which branch we are in & also to check how many branches that machine has>

when we create a new branch the files which are present in the source branch will reflect in all the branches unless we add and commit
  
  
  
git rebase
	the rebase is the concept that to merge th all files in one branch
			for this we need to go into the branch where you want to merge use the git merge command
				
				suppose you want add the development branch files into your master so you should go into the master branch and use the command 
					
						"git rebase development"
						
				suppose you want add the master branch files into yous development so you should go into the development branch and use the command
					
						"git rebase master"

ther is no commit id or rebase id for rebase command and once we merge the branches with rebase command we can't revert it back
